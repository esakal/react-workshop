# About this workshop
This workshop was created as a preparation to a course about React hooks, state managements (using context), routing and some other advanced techniques. [Unit 'Novice-2'] elaborate about whats' included in this workshop. Keep in mind that we aim to use hooks where possible, this workshop was created to provide essential information prior to the course.

This workshop is divided into small units and each unit is divided into tasks. 

1. Participant complete a task based on a checklist of requirements.
2. Before continuing to next task, the presenter perform a joined session to review the suggested solution, provide insights and reasoning about the implementation and answer questions.
2. Each task changes can be viewed in a dedicated pull request to simplify tracking changes and code implementation.
3. Under each unit the tasks are related so the participant can decide if he wants to continue with his code or checkout a prepared branch if his code is incomplete.

> Although anyone can follow the unit guides and complete this workshop, it was build based on the assumption that after each task the presenter will provide insights and reasoning about the implementation.
