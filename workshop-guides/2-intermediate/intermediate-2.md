# React workshop - Unit Intermediate-2

## Overview
This unit cover some more advanced techniques

## Unit Tickets
> In this unit the layout components were refactored to include the actual look&feel and also to gain access to dedicated context used as state management. As mentioned earlier we will not discuss about the implementation of the state management as it will be covered in the following course.
>
> IMPORTANT: This unit introduce two types of components, smart and dump components. You are adviced not to change the type of the components. if a component is wrapped with High order component (HOC) it means that it has access to the context, all other component should be treated as dump components.
